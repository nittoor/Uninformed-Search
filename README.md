Uninformed-Search
=================

a program to implement the following search algorithms, to help Alice
find optimal traversal path(s) to send her message to reach Noah.
1. Breadth-first search (30 pts)
2. Depth-first search (30 pts)
3. Uniform-cost search using time as cost (40 pts)
Note: When the costs of expanding two or more nodes are equal, we require that you expand
them alphabetically (i.e. David before Sophie). This will ensure that there is only one correct
solution for each problem.

The program should output the nodes (separated by “-”) in the order that show the
path of forwarding the message. For example, Alice-Ben-Frank-Gill-Mark-Noah.
There should be three .txt output files (one for each algorithm).
1. breadth-first.result.txt
2. depth-first.result.txt
3. uniform-cost.result.txt
